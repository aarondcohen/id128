# Id128

Generate 128-bit unique identifiers for various specifications.  In particular:
- [ULID](#ulid)
- [Monotonic ULID](#ulidmonotonic)
- [Nil UUID](#uuidnil)
- [UUID Variant 1 Version 4](#uuid4)

# Common Usage

```es6
import {
	Ulid,
	UlidMonotonic,
	Uuid4
	UuidNil,
} from 'id128';

// Id factories
[
	Ulid,
	UlidMonotonic,
	Uuid4
	UuidNil,
].forEach((IdType) => {
	// Generate a new id
	const id = IdType.generate();

	// Get the smallest valid id
	const min = IdType.MIN();

	// Get the largest valid id
	const max = IdType.MAX();

	// Compare ids
	console.log(id.equals(id));
	console.log(! id.equals(min));
	console.log(! id.equals(max));
	console.log(id.compare(min) === 1);
	console.log(id.compare(id) === 0);
	console.log(id.compare(max) === -1);

	// Encode the id in its canonical form
	const canonical = id.toCanonical();
	console.log(canonical);

	// Encode the id for efficient db storage
	const raw = id.toRaw();
	console.log(raw);

	// Decode a valid canonically formatted id
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromCanonical(canonical)));

	// Decode a canonically formatted id, skipping validation
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromCanonicalTrusted(canonical)));

	// Decode a valid raw formatted id
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromRaw(raw)));

	// Decode a raw formatted id, skipping validation
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromRawTrusted(raw)));
});
```

# Ulid
```es6
import { Ulid } from 'id128';
```

Ulid, as [specified](https://github.com/ulid/spec), has some nice properties:
- collision resistant: 80-bits of randomness
- k-ordered: prefixed with millisecond precision timestamp
- database friendly: fits within a uuid and generally appends to the index
- human friendly: canonically encodes as a case-insensitive Crockford 32 number

It is useful when you need a distributed domain unique id.

## Additional Properties

### time
Return a Date object for the epoch milliseconds encoded in the id.

## Additional Methods

### .generate(time) => id
Return a new id instance.  By default, the current time is generated on each call.
Setting `time` to `null` or `undefined` triggers the default behavior.
`time` can be given either as a `Date` object or epoch milliseconds
(milliseconds since January 1st, 1970).  For times prior to the epoch or after
approximately August 2nd, 10889, throws `InvalidSeed`. This is provided mostly
for unit tests.

## Byte Format
Format `ttttttrrrrrrrrrr` where:
- `t` is 8 bits of time
- `r` is 8 bits of random

# UlidMonotonic
```es6
import { UlidMonotonic } from 'id128';
```

UlidMonotonic is inspired by the [specification](https://github.com/ulid/spec#monotonicity),
however has some key differences:
- collision resistant: 15-bits of random seeded clock sequence plus 64-bits of randomness
- total ordered: prefixed with millisecond precision timestamp plus 15-bit clock sequence
- database friendly: fits within a uuid and generally appends to the index
- human friendly: canonically encodes as a case-insensitive Crockford 32 number

It is useful when you need a server unique id.

## Additional Properties

### time
Return a Date object for the epoch milliseconds encoded in the id.

## Additional Methods

### .generate(time) => id
Return a new id instance.  By default, the current time is generated on each call.
Setting `time` to `null` or `undefined` triggers the default behavior.
`time` can be given either as a `Date` object or epoch milliseconds
(milliseconds since January 1st, 1970).  For times prior to the epoch or after
approximately August 2nd, 10889, throws `InvalidSeed`.  Extra caution is required
since setting a future time and subsequently calling `generate` guarantees usage
of the clock sequence.  Throws `ClockSequenceOverflow` when the clock sequence
is exhausted.  This is provided mostly for unit tests.

### .resetClockSequence()
Return the clock sequence to its starting position.  This is provided mostly for
unit tests.

## Byte Format
Format `ttttttccrrrrrrrr` where:
- `t` is 8 bits of time
- `c` is 8 bits of random-seeded clock sequence
- `r` is 8 bits of random

More specifically, the clock sequence is a counter.  When the first id for a new
timestamp is generated, the clock sequence is seeded with random bits and the
left-most clock sequence bit is set to 0, reserving 2^15 clock ticks.  Whenever
a time from the past (now is so ephemeral) seeds the generator, the previous id's
time and clock sequence is used instead, incremented by 1.  This guarantees strict
local monotonicity and preserves lexical ordering.

Given UlidMonotonic currently generates approximately 700 ids per millisecond,
the clock sequence should never overflow.  This also means the left most bit of
the clock sequence will rarely be set to 1.  However, in the unlikely event of
an overflow, id generation should be aborted.

# Uuid4
```es6
import { Uuid4 } from 'id128';
```

Uuid4 implements the [RFC 4122 random uuid specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4):

- 122 random bits
- 2 bits reserved for the variant (1)
- 4 bits reserved for the version (4)

It is useful when you need a well-supported globally unique id.

## Additional Properties

### variant
Return the variant as encoded in the id.  Should be 1.

### version
Return the version as encoded in the id.  Should be 4.

# UuidNil
```es6
import { UuidNil } from 'id128';
```

UuidNil implements the [RFC 4122 nil uuid specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.7):

- 128 bits of glorious 0

It is useful as placeholder for other 128-bit ids.

## Additional Properties

### variant
Return the variant as encoded in the id.  Should be 0.

### version
Return the version as encoded in the id.  Should be 0.

# Motivation

Originally, I was looking for an id that is independent of the database, but plays
nice with database indices and data types.  Most databases have built-in support
for storing UUIDs efficiently, but UUID v4 fragments the index and the other UUIDs
require bit manipulation to get good performance, which will likely cause future
maintenance headaches.

After a bit of research, ULID was determined to nicely solve the problem.  However,
the javascript implementation had 2 major issues:
1. lacks database support
2. it's slow, which in a single-threaded Node server is deadly

I considered sending in a patch, however I saw an opportunity for a more expressive
interface, which is typically a bit harder to modify once a project is in wide use.
There was also a clear pattern for encoding 128-bit ids into various formats,
which seems generally useful.

Ultimately, this library strives to be:
- secure: uses cryptographic randomness to ensure general uniqueness
- performant: currently one of the fastest id generators available
- maintainable: heavily tested isoldated code with a consistent interface
- extensible: modular design to easily add new ids and new encodings

Much of this library would not exist without the great work and documentation of
other engineers.  In particular:

- [ksuid](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid): an in-depth exploration of the guid nuances
- [ulid](https://github.com/ulid/javascript): an elegant solution to a persistent problem
- [uuid-random](https://github.com/jchook/uuid-random): allocating pages of randomness is by far the biggest performance factor
