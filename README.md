	UlidMonotonic,
	Uuid1,
	Uuid4,
	UuidNil,
} = require('id128');

// Id factories
[
	Ulid,
	UlidMonotonic,
	Uuid1,
	Uuid4,
	UuidNil,
].forEach((IdType) => {
	// Identify the factory
	console.log(IdType.name);

	// Generate a new id
	const id = IdType.generate();

	// Get the smallest valid id
	const min = IdType.MIN();

	// Get the largest valid id
	const max = IdType.MAX();

	// Compare ids
	console.log(id.equal(id));
	console.log(! id.equal(min));
	console.log(! id.equal(max));
	console.log(id.compare(min) === 1);
	console.log(id.compare(id) === 0);
	console.log(id.compare(max) === -1);

	// Encode the id in its canonical form
	const canonical = id.toCanonical();
	console.log(canonical);

	// Encode the id for efficient db storage
	const raw = id.toRaw();
	console.log(raw);

	// Decode a valid canonically formatted id
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromCanonical(canonical)));

	// Decode a canonically formatted id, skipping validation
	console.log(id.equal(IdType.fromCanonicalTrusted(canonical)));

	// Decode a valid raw formatted id

# Ulid
```es6
const { Ulid } = require('id128');
```

Ulid, as [specified](https://github.com/ulid/spec), has some nice properties:
- collision resistant: 80-bits of randomness
- k-ordered: prefixed with millisecond precision timestamp
- database friendly: fits within a uuid and generally appends to the index
- human friendly: canonically encodes as a case-insensitive Crockford 32 number

It is useful when you need a distributed domain unique id.

## Additional Properties

### time
Return a Date object for the epoch milliseconds encoded in the id.

## Additional Methods

### .generate({ time }) => id
Return a new id instance.  By default, the current time is generated on each call.
Setting `time` to `null` or `undefined` triggers the default behavior.
`time` can be given either as a `Date` object or epoch milliseconds
(milliseconds since January 1st, 1970).  For times prior to the epoch or after
approximately August 2nd, 10889, throws `InvalidEpoch`. This is provided mostly
for unit tests.

## Byte Format
Format `ttttttrrrrrrrrrr` where:
- `t` is 8 bits of time
- `r` is 8 bits of random

# UlidMonotonic
```es6
const { UlidMonotonic } = require('id128');
```

UlidMonotonic is inspired by the [specification](https://github.com/ulid/spec#monotonicity):
- collision resistant: 15-bits of random seeded clock sequence plus 64-bits of randomness
- total ordered: prefixed with millisecond precision timestamp plus 15-bit clock sequence
- database friendly: fits within a uuid and generally appends to the index
- human friendly: canonically encodes as a case-insensitive Crockford 32 number

It is useful when you need to guarantee a process unique id.

## Additional Properties

### time
Return a Date object for the epoch milliseconds encoded in the id.

## Additional Methods

### .generate({ time }) => id
Return a new id instance.  By default, the current time is generated on each call.
Setting `time` to `null` or `undefined` triggers the default behavior.
`time` can be given either as a `Date` object or epoch milliseconds
(milliseconds since January 1st, 1970).  For times prior to the epoch or after
approximately August 2nd, 10889, throws `InvalidEpoch`.  Extra caution is required
since setting a future time and subsequently calling `generate` guarantees usage
of the clock sequence.  Throws `ClockSequenceOverflow` when the clock sequence
is exhausted.  This is provided mostly for unit tests.

### .resetClockSequence()
Return the clock sequence to its starting position.  This is provided mostly for
unit tests.

## Byte Format
Format `ttttttccrrrrrrrr` where:
- `t` is 8 bits of time
- `c` is 8 bits of random-seeded clock sequence
- `r` is 8 bits of random

More specifically, the clock sequence is a counter.  When the first id for a new
timestamp is generated, the clock sequence is seeded with random bits and the
left-most clock sequence bit is set to 0, reserving 2^15 clock ticks.  Whenever
a time from the past (now is so ephemeral) seeds the generator, the previous id's
time and clock sequence is used instead, incremented by 1.  This guarantees strict
local monotonicity and preserves lexical ordering and general randomness.

Given UlidMonotonic currently generates approximately 850 ids per millisecond,
the clock sequence should never overflow.  This also means the left most bit of
the clock sequence will rarely be set to 1.  However, in the unlikely event of
an overflow, id generation should be aborted.

# Uuid1
```es6
const { Uuid1 } = require('id128');
```

Uuid1 implements the [RFC 4122 time specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.2):
- time-based: encodes the current millisecond timestamp
- location-based: encodes the mac address of the machine

While this mostly adheres to the spec, there are a few nuances in the handling
of time.  Instead of encoding time as 100-nanoseconds since the Gregorian epoch,
48 bits encode milliseconds since the Gregorian epoch time and 12 bits count past
time collisions, resetting whenever given a new future time.  There are a few benefits:
- high precision time is unreliable in the browser so this ensures better precision
- the max supported date is now around the year 10502 instead of around 5236
- generating 4096 ids/ms (~4,000,000 ids/s) is wildly unlikely in real world uses
- in the rare  hi-res overflow, the count simply spills over to the clock sequence

## Additional Properties

### clock_sequence
Return the clock sequence encoded in the id.

### hires_time
Return the number of prior ids generated while time stood still.

### node
Raturn the MAC address encoded in the id.

### time
Return a Date object for the epoch milliseconds encoded in the id.

### variant
Return the variant as encoded in the id.  Should be 1.

### version
Return the version as encoded in the id.  Should be 4.

## Additional Methods

### .generate({ node, time }) => id
Return a new id instance.  By default, the current time is generated on each call
and the MAC address is used as the node.  When the MAC address is unavailable,
the node defaults to a random multicast address instead.  Setting both `node` and
`time` to `null` or `undefined` triggers the default behavior.
`time` can be given either as a `Date` object or Gregorian milliseconds
(milliseconds since October 15th, 1582).  For times prior to the Gregorian epoch
or after approximately May 17, 10502, throws `InvalidEpoch`.  Extra caution is
required since setting a future time and subsequently calling `generate`
guarantees usage of the hi-res counter and clock sequence.  Time should only be
manipulated manually in testing.

### .reset()
Return the hi-res counter to its starting position and generate a new random
clock sequence seed.  This is provided mostly for unit tests.

## Byte Format
Format `llll lnnn mmmm vhhh tccc aaaa aaaa aaaa` where:
- `l` is 4 bits of low millisecond time
- `n` is 4 bits of hi-res time
- `m` is 4 bits of mid millisecond time
- `v` is 4 bits of the version
- `h` is 4 bits of high millisecond time
- `t` is 2 bits of the variant followed by 2 bits of the clock sequence
- `c` is 4 bits of the clock sequence
- `a` is 4 bits of the machine address

# Uuid4
```es6
const { Uuid4 } = require('id128');
```

Uuid4 implements the [RFC 4122 random uuid specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4):

- 122 random bits
- 2 bits reserved for the variant (1)
- 4 bits reserved for the version (4)

It is useful when you need a well-supported globally unique id.

## Additional Properties

### variant
Return the variant as encoded in the id.  Should be 1.

### version
Return the version as encoded in the id.  Should be 4.

## Byte Format
Format `rrrr rrrr rrrr vrrr trrr rrrr rrrr rrrr` where:
- `r` is 4 bits of random
- `v` is 4 bits of the version
- `t` is 2 bits of the variant followed by 2 bits of random

# UuidNil
```es6
const { UuidNil } = require('id128');
```

UuidNil implements the [RFC 4122 nil uuid specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.7):

- 128 bits of glorious 0

It is useful as placeholder for other 128-bit ids.

## Additional Properties

### variant
Return the variant as encoded in the id.  Should be 0.

### version
Return the version as encoded in the id.  Should be 0.

## Byte Format
Format `0000 0000 0000 v000 t000 0000 0000 0000` where:
- `0` is 4 bits of 0
- `v` is 4 bits of the version (also 0)
- `t` is 2 bits of the variant (also 0) followed by 2 bits of 0

# Exceptions
```es6
const { Exception } = require('id128');
```
All exceptions are namespaced under `Exception` for clarity.

## Id128Error
```es6
const { Exception: { Id128Error } } = require('id128');
```
Base exception class for generic error catching.

## ClockSequenceOverflow
```es6
const { Exception: { ClockSequenceOverflow } } = require('id128');
```
Incrementing the clock sequence is impossible.  Should not happen unless manually seeding `#generate`.

## InvalidBytes
```es6
const { Exception: { InvalidBytes } } = require('id128');
```
Encoding something other than 16 bytes.  Likely to happen when encoding untrusted user input.

## InvalidEncoding
```es6
const { Exception: { InvalidEncoding } } = require('id128');
```
Decoding an invalid format or non-string object.  Likely to happen when decoding untrusted user input.

## InvalidEpoch
```es6
const { Exception: { InvalidEpoch } } = require('id128');
```
Generating an id with an invalid timestamp.  Should not happen unless manually seeding `#generate`.

# Browser Support

This module supports browser compilation though Webpack/Browserify with a few caveats:
- Random number generation is optimized for memory usage over speed since only a
handful of ids are likely to be generated during a user's session so the overhead
of generating a page of random values has poor amortized cost.
- The browser must have native support for `crypto`.  `Math.random` is far too
insecure to support as a fallback, especially since the fallback only makes sense
for older browsers with proven security holes.  `msCrypto` is not a supported
fallback due to many of the other required features.
- The browser must support:
	* classes
	* closures
	* `const` and `let`
	* `for...of` loops
	* `Uint8Array`
	* `Symbol`

This library is intended for modern browsers that keep pace with Javascript's
growing ecosystem.  I philosophically object to supporting efforts of companies
to pour more money into broken browsers that only cause headaches for developers
to support.  I expect these caveats to be unnecessary within the next 5 years.

All that said, please notify me of any issues with modern browsers and I'll do
my best to support you.

# Motivation

Originally, I was looking for an id that is independent of the database, but plays
nice with database indices and data types.  Most databases have built-in support
for storing UUIDs efficiently, but UUID v4 does not cluster well and the other UUIDs
require bit manipulation to get good performance, which will likely cause future
maintenance headaches.

After a bit of research, ULID was determined to nicely solve the problem.  However,
the javascript implementation had 2 major issues:
1. lacks database support
2. it's slow, which in a single-threaded Node server is deadly

I considered sending in a patch, however I saw an opportunity for a more expressive
interface, which is typically a bit harder to modify once a project is in wide use.
There was also a clear pattern for encoding 128-bit ids into various formats,
which seems generally useful.

Ultimately, this library strives to be:
- secure: uses cryptographic randomness to ensure general uniqueness
- performant: currently one of the fastest id generators available
- maintainable: heavily tested isolated code with a consistent interface
- extensible: modular design to easily add new ids and new encodings
